                        Time management is the way your time is organized and divided so that you can complete more tasks in less time. It’ll help you to avoid stress even in the most loaded periods, boost your productivity, and help you to achieve any goal <a href="references.html">[2]</a>.

                            <li>Identify which assignments are not necessary, can be delegated, or postponed without any negative consequences because it’s hardly impossible to do all the tasks in one day or even a week</li>
                            <li>Schedule your activities — it’s recommended that you first arrange your personal needs (sleep, meals, rest, etc), then meetings, and only after them all other tasks</li>

                        Here are some tips to make your planning even more effective and easier for you.

                        <li>
                            Divide all the big tasks into smaller ones so that every assignment will not take more than 15 minutes to complete <a href="references.html">[4]</a>.

                            If you struggle to do a hard job, you can persuade yourself that the task is not complicated at all — say “I’ll not spend more than 10 minutes on it!” — this will help you stay motivated. However, when 10 minutes are up, you will more likely to continue working, because you’ll see that the beginning is always the hardest part <a href="references.html">[1]</a>.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Use Pomodoro Technique so you do not get exhausted too quickly — work for 20-30 minutes (the work session is called “Pomodoro”), then rest for 5-10 minutes. After each fourth Pomodoro, take a long break — from 15 to 25 minutes. The duration of each session can be adjusted according to your needs, wants, and temp <a href="references.html">[4]</a>.

                            Before planning your activities, prioritize your tasks by urgent/not urgent and important not important by using the matrix below <a href="references.html">[4]</a>.

                            In the morning, start by eating the “frog” — do the hardest task first. At the very beginning of the day, you have the biggest amount of energy, and your brain is not overloaded yet, hence the sooner you complete the most complicated assignment the easier it will be for you. Also, you will have enough power for easier tasks and they won’t be a burden for you <a href="references.html">[4]</a>.
